# Power-BI-Retail-Dashboard_2
This Dashboard is related to Axon Retail Company Dashboard.
The problem we faced was the management's inability to track data accurately and timely. To address this, we have created a dashboard. This dashboard not only centralizes and tracks data, but it also assists management in formulating better strategies and making data-driven decisions.
The report provides a list of top-performing cities, enabling you to identify what might be lacking in other cities. This information can be used to focus on areas of improvement in those less performing cities.
There is a cancel order sheet that allows you to track and record orders that have been cancelled. It also enables you to read comments associated with these cancellations, helping you to identify and address the underlying issues. By analyzing this data, you can develop strategies to reduce order cancellations, as observed in the year 2005.
The report provides a monthly order count, allowing you to identify which months are performing well and which are not, so you can then devise appropriate strategies.
The report includes all the details of top-selling products and employees, along with other factors that can contribute to improving your revenue.
